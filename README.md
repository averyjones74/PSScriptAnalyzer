Introduction
============
PSScriptAnalyzer is a static code checker for Windows PowerShell modules and scripts. PSScriptAnalyzer checks the quality of Windows PowerShell code by running a set of rules.
The rules are based on PowerShell best practices identified by PowerShell Team and the community. It generates DiagnosticResults (errors and warnings) to inform users about potential
code defects and suggests possible solutions for improvements.

PSScriptAnalyzer is shipped with a collection of built-in rules that checks various aspects of PowerShell code such as presence of uninitialized variables, usage of PSCredential Type,
usage of Invoke-Expression etc. Additional functionalities such as exclude/include specific rules are also supported.

PSScriptAnalyzer Cmdlets
======================
``` PowerShell
Get-ScriptAnalyzerRule [-CustomizedRulePath <string[]>] [-Name <string[]>] [<CommonParameters>] [-Severity <string[]>]

Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer [-Path] <string> [-CustomizedRulePath <string[]>] [-ExcludeRule <string[]>] [-IncludeRule <string[]>] [-Severity <string[]>] [-Recurse] [<CommonParameters>]
```

Suppressing Rules
=================

You can suppress a rule by decorating a script/function or script/function parameter with .NET's [SuppressMessageAttribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.codeanalysis.suppressmessageattribute.aspx).
`SuppressMessageAttribute`'s constructor takes two parameters: a category and a check ID. Set the `categoryID` parameter to the name of the rule you want to suppress and set the `checkID` parameter to a null or empty string:

``` PowerShell
function SuppressMe()
{
    [Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSProvideCommentHelp", "")]
    param()

    Write-Verbose -Message "I'm making a difference!"

}
```

All rule violations within the scope of the script/function/parameter you decorate will be suppressed.

To suppress a message on a specific parameter, set the `SuppressMessageAttribute`'s `CheckId` parameter to the name of the parameter:
``` PowerShell
function SuppressTwoVariables()
{
    [Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSProvideDefaultParameterValue", "b")]
    [Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSProvideDefaultParameterValue", "a")]
    param([string]$a, [int]$b)
    {
    }
}
```

Use the `SuppressMessageAttribute`'s `Scope` property to limit rule suppression to functions or classes within the attribute's scope.

Use the value `Function` to suppress violations on all functions within the attribute's scope. Use the value `Class` to suppress violations on all classes within the attribute's scope:

``` PowerShell
[Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSProvideCommentHelp", "", Scope="Function")]
param(
)

function InternalFunction
{
    param()

    Write-Verbose -Message "I am invincible!"
}
```

The above example demonstrates how to suppress rule violations for internal functions using the `SuppressMessageAttribute`'s `Scope` property.

You can further restrict suppression based on a function/parameter/class/variable/object's name by setting the `SuppressMessageAttribute's` `Target` property to a regular expression. Any function/parameter/class/variable/object whose name matches the regular expression is skipped.

``` PowerShell
[Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSAvoidUsingPositionalParameters", Scope="Function", Target="PositionalParametersAllowed")]
Param(
)

function PositionalParametersAllowed()
{
    Param([string]$Parameter1)
    {
        Write-Verbose $Parameter1
    }

}

function PositionalParametersNotAllowed()
{
    param([string]$Parameter1)
    {
        Write-Verbose $Parameter1
    }
}

# The script analyzer will skip this violation
PositionalParametersAllowed 'value1'

# The script analyzer will report this violation
PositionalParametersNotAllowed 'value1
```

To match all functions/variables/parameters/objects, use `*` as the value of the Target parameter:
``` PowerShell
[Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSAvoidUsingPositionalParameters", Scope="Function", Target="*")]
Param(
)
```

**Note**: Rule suppression is currently supported only for built-in rules.

Settings Support in ScriptAnalyzer
========================================
Settings that describe ScriptAnalyzer rules to include/exclude based on `Severity` can be created and supplied to
`Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` using the `Setting` parameter. This enables a user to create a custom configuration for a specific environment. We support the following modes for specifying the settings file.

## Explicit

The following example excludes two rules from the default set of rules and any rule
that does not output an Error or Warning diagnostic record.

``` PowerShell
# PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1
@{
    Severity=@('Error','Warning')
    ExcludeRules=@('PSAvoidUsingCmdletAliases',
                'PSAvoidUsingWriteHost')
}
```

Then invoke that settings file when using `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer`:

``` PowerShell
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path MyScript.ps1 -Setting ScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1
```

The next example selects a few rules to execute instead of all the default rules.

``` PowerShell
# PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1
@{
    IncludeRules=@('PSAvoidUsingPlainTextForPassword',
                'PSAvoidUsingConvertToSecureStringWithPlainText')
}
```

Then invoke that settings file when using:
``` PowerShell
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path MyScript.ps1 -Setting ScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1
```

## Implicit
If you place a PSScriptAnayzer settings file named `PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` in your project root, PSScriptAnalyzer will discover it if you pass the project root as the `Path` parameter.

```PowerShell
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path "C:\path\to\project" -Recurse
```

Note that providing settings explicitly takes higher precedence over this implicit mode. Sample settings files are provided [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/master/Engine/Settings).

ScriptAnalyzer as a .NET library
================================

ScriptAnalyzer engine and functionality can now be directly consumed as a library.

Here are the public interfaces:
``` c#
using Microsoft.Windows.PowerShell.ScriptAnalyzer;

public void Initialize(System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.Runspace runspace,
Microsoft.Windows.PowerShell.ScriptAnalyzer.IOutputWriter outputWriter,
[string[] customizedRulePath = null],
[string[] includeRuleNames = null],
[string[] excludeRuleNames = null],
[string[] severity = null],
[bool suppressedOnly = false],
[string profile = null])

public System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<DiagnosticRecord> AnalyzePath(string path,
    [bool searchRecursively = false])

public System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<IRule> GetRule(string[] moduleNames, string[] ruleNames)
```

Violation Correction
====================
Most violations can be fixed by replacing the violation causing content with the correct alternative.

In an attempt to provide the user with the ability to correct the violation we provide a property, `SuggestedCorrections`, in each DiagnosticRecord instance,
that contains information needed to rectify the violation.

For example, consider a script `C:\tmp\test.ps1` with the following content:
``` PowerShell
PS> Get-Content C:\tmp\test.ps1
gci C:\
```

Invoking PSScriptAnalyzer on the file gives the following output.
``` PowerShell
PS>$diagnosticRecord = Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path C:\tmp\test.p1
PS>$diagnosticRecord | select SuggestedCorrections | Format-Custom

class DiagnosticRecord
{
  SuggestedCorrections =
    [
    class CorrectionExtent
    {
        EndColumnNumber = 4
        EndLineNumber = 1
        File = C:\Users\kabawany\tmp\test3.ps1
        StartColumnNumber = 1
        StartLineNumber = 1
        Text = Get-ChildItem
        Description = Replace gci with Get-ChildItem
    }
  ]
}
```

The `*LineNumber` and `*ColumnNumber` properties give the region of the script that can be replaced by the contents of `Text` property, i.e., replace gci with Get-ChildItem.

The main motivation behind having `SuggestedCorrections` is to enable quick-fix like scenarios in editors like VSCode, Sublime, etc. At present, we provide valid `SuggestedCorrection` only for the following rules, while gradually adding this feature to more rules.

* AvoidAlias.cs
* AvoidUsingPlainTextForPassword.cs
* MisleadingBacktick.cs
* MissingModuleManifestField.cs
* UseToExportFieldsInManifest.cs
